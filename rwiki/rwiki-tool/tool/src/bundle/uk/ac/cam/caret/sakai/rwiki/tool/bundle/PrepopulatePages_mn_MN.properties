wiki_home_page=\nh1 Welcome to the Wiki Tool\n\n\n\nh3 What is a wiki?\n\n\n\nA wiki is a tool which allows people to create web pages individually or as a group, without needing any web skills.\n\n\n\nUsing the wiki tool, you can create and edit web pages within your worksite. If you wish, you can make all or some pages publicly viewable.\n\n\n\nh3 Using wikis for teaching\n\nThere are a wide number of ways to use wikis for teaching - a web search will find any number of suggestions and case studies. For example, students can develop a collection of resources about the topic they are studying, and make them available to the outside world. Other lecturers like to produce a wiki page as a way of publishing lecture notes and course guidance for students to read but not edit.\n\n\n\nh3 Using wikis for research groups\n\nA wiki allows people to work on producing a document together, such as to draft research proposals as a team, or to keep an up to date list of project contacts.\n\n\n\nh3 How do we get started?\n\nThis is the home page for your wiki. To add text to it\:\n\n* Click the 'edit' button in the actions bar above.\n\n* You will see the text on this page appear in an editable text box.\n\n* Delete this "starter" text , and type in the text that you want to appear instead. To format the text, use the button icons, which will insert the appropriate wiki formatting codes.\n\n* Click the 'save' button.\n\n
